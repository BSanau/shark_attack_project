## Cleaning and wrangling

Cleaning and wrangling dataset by dropping duplicates, deleting columns and filling null values. Countries are grouped in bigger regions and shark species are identified using regular expressions.

## Analysis

* Regions with more attacks are analyzed.
* Number of attacks along the year is plotted for several regions.
* Shark species that attack in a region are plotted.
* Number of times a shark species attacks in the USA and Australia is plotted throughout the year.
